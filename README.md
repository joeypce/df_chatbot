## Contextual Chatbot
A contextual chatbot based on data from https://va.ecitizen.gov.sg/cfp/customerpages/msf/bb/explorefaq.aspx is developed. The architecture of the chatbot adopts the Django framework. The natural language processing component make use of Google's Dialogflow. The aim of this project is to humanize chatbot through certain actions like small talks and improve accuracy of existing chatbot.

The chatbot is created with the objective to understand as much user input as possible, where Singlish is likely used in the local context. User input can come in a wide variety of permutations and the problem with many chatbot is that it may not be able to provide user with the best and most accurate answers. An algorithm was developed to make this possible.
