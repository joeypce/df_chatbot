You can check your organisation's eligibility to be a Baby Bonus Approved Institution on the Approved Institution Portal.
Under the Approved Institution Terms and Conditions, each business outlet or centre belonging to the same eligible institution must be independently registered as a Baby Bonus Approved Institution before it can deduct funds from the Child Development Account or CDA for approved uses.

CorpPass stands for Singapore Corporate Access. Its concept is similar to SingPass. SingPass is for individuals while CorpPass is for organisations. In order to continue transacting online with Government agencies, your entity will need to have a CorpPass by 31 Aug 2018. You can visit the CorpPass website to find out more on how to register for CorpPass.
Approved Persons will no longer be able to use SingPass to access the Approved Institution (AI) Portal from 1 September 2018. Please register for CorpPass soon if your entity has not done so.
You must be an Approved Person or Authorised Affiliate in order to log in to the Approved Institution Portal or AI Portal. If you are an Approved Person or Authorised Affiliate and wish to access AI e-services with your CorpPass, your entity’s nominated CorpPass Administrator has to first assign you the user role for “Baby Bonus Approved Institutions (BBAI) digital service” on the CorpPass website. Users who have CorpPass but are not Approved Persons would not be able to access.
You can continue to use your SingPass to perform Government-to-Business (G2B) transactions on behalf of your entity until 31 August 2018. Agencies must register for CorpPass by 31 August 2018 in order to continue transacting online with the Government agencies from 1 September 2018.
Businesses currently conduct business transactions through multiple digital identities such as SingPass and EASY. Having a single corporate digital identity will increase convenience for users who transact with multiple government agencies, as they no longer need to handle multiple login IDs. CorpPass will also allow businesses to have greater control, as they will be able to grant and manage employee access to Government digital services.
All Local Agencies with a Unique Entity Number, or UEN, can apply for CorpPass. Local entities without a UEN are not eligible. Foreign entities and overseas organisations are eligible to apply, even if they do not have a local UEN. If you are eligible, you can apply for CorpPass on the CorpPass website.
CorpPass users must have a NRIC or FIN in order to apply to be an Approved Institution or Approved Person. If you are a foreigner and do not have a FIN, you may wish to consider nominating another person in your organisation to apply instead. Please also note that to be an Approved Institution, your organisation must be licensed or registered with the relevant regulatory or licensing body. An Approved Person should be a person authorised to make decision on behalf of the organisation.
The Approved Institution acceptance can only be made by your entity's Authorised Person. The Authorised Person will receive a notification to complete the Approved Institution acceptance. If your Authorised Person has a CorpPass, he or she can login to complete the acceptance. If not, your entity's nominated CorpPass administrator has to first assign the Authorised Person the user role for "Baby Bonus Approved Institutions (BBAI) digital service" on the CorpPass website.
A notification will be sent to the new AP to accept the terms and conditions. However, the new AP must first be assigned a CorpPass for the Baby Bonus Approved Institution e-Service.
If the Approved Person (AP) of the organisation wishes to update his or her business and personal particulars, he or she can do so by selecting the ‘Update AI Details’ service on our Approved Institution Portal.

The verification of the sibling relationship can be done by requesting the parents to log in to the Baby Bonus mobile application with their SingPass and use the Sibling Check function to retrieve details of their children.

You can use the Baby Bonus cash gift to pay for expenses for your new-born child.
If your child is born on or after 1 January 2015, you will receive the cash gifts in your selected bank account, in 5 payments within 18 months from the birth of the child. To check the scheduled payment date and cash gift payment date, you can select 'View Account Summary' under Services on Baby Bonus Online. For children who were born before 1 January 2015 and have enrolled for the scheme, you can also check their payment details using 'View Account Summary' under Services.
The cash gift is credited to a bank account nominated by the child’s parents. Parents can choose to deposit the Baby Bonus cash gift into a savings account, or the Child Development Account, or CDA.  If you choose to receive the cash gift in your child’s CDA, you will not be able to withdraw the money in cash.
The Baby Bonus scheme consists of 2 components: the Cash Gift and the Child Development Account or CDA. Both parents will have to agree on who will: receive the Cash Gift as a Bank Account Holder, and/or manage the Child Development Account as a CDA trustee. The person can either be the parent of the child or a third party.  The Cash Gift bank account holder and CDA trustee can be the same person or different persons. The CDA trustee has to be above the age of 18 and not a bankrupt. The Cash Gift will be credited to the Bank Account Holder’s selected bank account. The bank account can be a personal or a joint bank account with the child. The CDA is a separate special savings account for children to help build up the savings that can be spent on approved uses. It is not a regular savings account. When a CDA is opened, the child will receive CDA benefits, comprising the CDA First Step and dollar-for-dollar Government matching contributions. The CDA First Step will be credited into the CDA within 2 weeks from the opening of the account. Parents can save in the CDA and receive dollar-for-dollar matching from the Government up to a maximum cap based on the child’s birth order. Parents' savings will be matched by the Government within 2 weeks.
For Baby Bonus Cash gift payments, you will receive an SMS or Email notification on the expected date of payment around 3 to 5 working days before the scheduled payment date. You may check the cash gift payment schedule by using “Services” on Baby Bonus Online, followed by “View Account Summary”.
For OCBC bank account holders, please enter your account number from the fourth digit onwards. The first 3 digits of your account number are the bank’s branch code.
You will not be taxed for the Baby Bonus cash gift, as Baby Bonus benefits are non-taxable.
To be eligible for Child Development Account (CDA) First Step, your child must be: born on or after 24 March 2016, and a Singapore citizen or become a citizen before 12 years old. To check if your child is eligible for CDA First Step, you can use the “Check Eligibility” on Baby Bonus Online.
It was announced in Budget 2015 that all Singaporean children born between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2015 will receive a top-up of $300 or $600 in their Child Development Account or CDA if the CDA was opened by 30 June 2016. There is no Government matching to this amount.
If your child is entitled to the Child Development Account (CDA) First Step and the CDA is opened, you will receive $3,000 in your child's CDA within 2 weeks. You can check if you have received the CDA First Step by going to Baby Bonus Online and select ‘View/Update My Baby Bonus Details’, followed by 'View Statement'.
Trustees of the Child Development Account (CDA) can change the CDA bank by going to Baby Bonus Online and select ‘View/Update My Baby Bonus Details’. The new CDA will be opened within 3 working days. Upon the successful opening of the CDA, the new CDA bank will send you the Baby Bonus NETS card, and you can continue to save into the new CDA. The transfer of funds from Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) to your new CDA bank may take up to 3 weeks after the account is opened. This is due to the backend processing time required to credit the funds from the closed CDA to the new CDA.
You can change your Child Development Account (CDA) bank online anytime till 31 October 2018. We encourage CDA trustees to change their CDA bank early so that you have sufficient time to make an informed decision before the deadline.
If you do not change your Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore) CDA to another CDA bank by 31 October 2018, you will automatically be assigned one of the three CDA banks appointed by MSF. Your new CDA will be opened by the first week of January 2019. You may change your preferred CDA bank on the Baby Bonus Online using Services after the assigned new CDA is opened.
If you are the Child Development Account (CDA) trustee, and you do not have a SingPass, you must complete the hardcopy form enclosed in the letter sent by MSF to change your CDA bank. You can email the completed form to MSF at MSF_Babybonus@msf.gov.sg, or post it to: Baby Bonus and Leave Branch Family@Enabling Village 20 Lengkok Bahru, #04-02 Singapore 159053. If you did not receive the form, please write to us using this form. Simply enter ‘Change of CDA bank form’ in the Subject field and key in your details. After receiving your form, we will send a Letter of Authorisation (LOA) to you by post within 10 days. You can use the LOA to open a new CDA personally at the CDA bank of your choice.
If your child turns 12 years old in 2018, you do not need to change to another Child Development Account (CDA) bank. The CDA will automatically be closed on 31 December 2018, and the balance will be transferred to the Post-Secondary Education Account, or PSEA, under the Ministry of Education in January 2019.
The Government appoints Child Development Account (CDA) banks through an open tender process. We considered and evaluated the proposals from the bidders carefully, before a decision was made. It is unfortunate that Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore) was not re-appointed. However, we are assured that the three CDA banks appointed are able to manage the CDAs well and meet the needs of the CDA trustees and their children.

AI completes the relevant part of the CDA Bank's GIRO application form. AI sends the completed GIRO application form to the CDA Bank. CDA Bank processes the GIRO form and returns rejected forms2 (if any) to the AI. AI sends collection instructions to the AI’s corporate bank once GIRO forms are accepted by the CDA bank. AI’s corporate bank informs the AI whether the GIRO deductions are successful or rejected.   For more information on GIRO processes, please contact your respective banks’ contact centres. Note:   The CDA trustee is either the parent or a person nominated by the child's parents as declared to MSF. AI must re-submit the GIRO forms with correct details if rejected by CDA bank.

Riders are not part of Integrated Shield Plans, and do not meet the Ministry of Health’s requirements to be Medisave-payable, which are to have a minimum deductible and minimum 10% co-insurance. These requirements are to help keep premiums affordable and to encourage prudent use of healthcare services.

The terms and conditions are spelt out in the Baby Bonus Online declaration clauses, as well as the terms and conditions governing the cash gift.
You do not need to change CDA trustee as the CDA will be closed on 31 December this year. The remaining funds will be transferred to your child’s Post-Secondary Education Account or PSEA administered by the Ministry of Education (MOE). MOE will inform you once the CDA balance has been transferred to the PSEA. MOE will also send annual statements to parents to keep you informed of the PSEA balance.
If there are unused funds in the Child Development Account (CDA) at the end of the year your turns 12 years old, the funds will be automatically transferred to your child’s Post-Secondary Education Account or PSEA, subject to the cap applicable to your child. The cap is based on the sum of the CDA Government contributions cap, the corresponding deposits made by parents or third parties, any Child Development Credit and any accrued interest. If there is any excess balance above this cap, MSF will notify the CDA trustee about the refund arrangement.
If there is excess CDA balance to be returned, it will be credited to the bank account as nominated by the CDA trustee in the year the child turns 13 years old. In the interest of the child, you may wish to discuss with the third party CDA trustee on the bank account to receive the refund.
The funds in the PSEA can be used by your child and his/her sibling for post-secondary education at the locally based ITE, polytechnics and universities.  For more information on how to use the PSEA, you may wish to visit Ministry of Education's website.

Search for and indicate interest in preschool facilities of your choice, through the use of geolocation technology, with accompanying information on school fees and vacancies; III.
